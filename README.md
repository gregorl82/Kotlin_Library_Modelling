<h1>Kotlin Library Modelling</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create your own library class with an internal collection of books.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MVP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Books should have title, author and genre.</li>
<li>Write a method to count the number of books in the library.</li>
<li>Write a method to add a book to the library stock.</li>
<li>Add a capacity to the library and write a method to check if stock is full before adding a book.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a third class which interacts with the other two. E.g. you could add a Borrower with a method that takes a Book and moves to the Borrower’s collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The library wants to keep track of it’s number of books by genre. Using a HashMap, store the genre of each book as the key - and a count of how many books of that genre as the value.</li>
</ul>
